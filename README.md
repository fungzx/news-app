## API Setup

API Used: GNews API (https://gnews.io/)

API Key:
- The application uses a GNews API key stored in app.js (API_KEY variable).

To use your own key:
- Sign up at https://gnews.io/ to obtain a free API key.
- Replace the API_KEY constant in app.js with your key:

Note: The free GNews API plan limits requests to 10 articles per call and has a daily quota.

## Approach

Data Handling:
- The application fetches news articles using the GNews API, either by search query, category, or default top headlines.
- Articles are stored in a currentArticles array and rendered as Bootstrap cards in a responsive grid.

Interactivity:
- Search: Submitting the search form triggers a new API request with the user's query.
- Category Filters: Clicking a category button fetches articles for that category and updates the UI to reflect the active filter.
- Article Details: Clicking an article card opens a Bootstrap modal displaying the article's title, image, content (or description if content is unavailable), and a link to the full article.
- Reset: Clicking the header resets the search input and category filters, fetching the default top headlines.

## Notes

The GNews API's free tier limits the number of articles to 10 per request, so the "Load More" button currently displays an alert. In a production environment, pagination or a premium API plan could be implemented.
